# tldr
* did this for IB Math Exploration (aka Math IA)
* use linear regression to predict stock prices and attempt to turn a profit using buy low sell high. Quite a scuffed "profit" algorithm but an otherwise decent linear regression prediction model.
* Compares a standard linear regression model using sum of squared errors (SSE) and a modified model using weighted sum of squared errors (WSSE).
* Will upload ME report + analysis + writing after IB ends
